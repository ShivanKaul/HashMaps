OmniMap
-------------
Search Google Maps directly from the Chrome Omnibox.

 In the Omnibox (the address bar in Google Chrome), simply type "#" (without quotes) and press Tab. Now, type in the address/name-of-establishment you need directions to. That's it. Yes, it's that simple.

 If you want directions to-and-from, simply type "X to Y", and it works. 

 For example, open up a new tab, type "#", press Tab, and then type in "McGill University to La Banquise". Voila. You are now navigated to cheesy goodness.
